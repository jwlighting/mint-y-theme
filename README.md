Hints
=====

- This theme is based on the Mint-Y theme, but blue instead of mint-green.
- Until now, no color changes are made for Cinnamon. Feel free to clone, edit and make a pull request for that.
- Because the Mint-Y icons are not available in blue, Mint-X-Aqua icons are used. This can be changed easily

Editing
=======

Do not makes modifications to the theme directly in the usr/share/themes directory. These are automatically generated from the files located in the src/ directory. Each subdirectory contains its own individual instructions on how to edit. Once edits are made you can generate the final themes by running the build-themes.py script.
